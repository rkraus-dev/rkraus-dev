# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Robert**, a Fullstack Developer based in Germany.

After 8 years in 2nd Level IT Support, I’ve decided to return to my roots in software development. I’m currently leveraging **The Odin Project** to sharpen my skills and transition into a professional Fullstack role.

This GitHub profile serves as my technical lab. While my code lives here, you can find a more personal look at my background, my journey, and my goals over at **[rkaus.dev](https://rkaus.dev)**.

My current focus is on **React, Node.js, and MongoDB**, with a strong emphasis on **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. Outside of coding, I enjoy the precision of 3D modeling and printing.

Feel free to check out my repositories as they grow. If you want to connect or talk about tech, you can find me on the platforms below!

### Fun Facts:

* **Tech Passion:** I love taking things apart to understand how they work—whether it's a buggy block of code or a broken household appliance. If it’s broken, I’ll probably try to fix it.
* **Creative Tool:** I use **Blender** to design and 3D print functional parts for everyday use.
* **Daily Routine:** Code, Gym, Sleep — Repeat. (No coffee needed, I run on logic).
* **Support Logic:** 8 years in 2nd Level Support taught me: The answer is almost always in the documentation — you just have to find it.
