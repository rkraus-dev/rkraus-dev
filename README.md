# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Robert**, a Fullstack Developer based in Germany.

After 8 years in 2nd Level IT Support, I’ve decided to return to my roots in software development. I’m currently completing the **Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum at freeCodeCamp**, mastering the entire JavaScript ecosystem while building custom projects for my portfolio.

This GitHub profile serves as my technical lab. While my code lives here, you can find a more personal look at my background, my journey, and my goals over at **[rkaus.dev](https://rkaus.dev)**.

My current focus is on **deepening my Full Stack expertise**, with a strong emphasis on writing accessible, clean code and mastering Git version control. Outside of coding, I enjoy the precision of 3D modeling and printing.

### Fun Facts:

* **Tech Passion:** I love taking things apart to understand how they work—whether it's a buggy block of code or a broken household appliance. If it’s broken, I’ll probably try to fix it.
* **Creative Tool:** I use **Blender** to design and 3D print functional parts for everyday use.
* **Daily Routine:** Code, Gym, Sleep — Repeat. (No coffee needed, I run on logic).
* **Support Logic:** 8 years in 2nd Level Support taught me: The answer is almost always in the documentation — you just have to find it.
